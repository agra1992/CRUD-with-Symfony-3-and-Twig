## Simple CRUD app with Symfony 3 and Twig

This is an example of a very basic CRUD app using Symfony 3 and Twig.

This is the app made during the first few videos [of this course][1].

The aim of this course is to show how you can use Symfony 3 (along with some other bundles) to quickly make a working
RESTful API to use as the back end for any modern front-end framework - such as Angular, React, Ember, or any of the
mobile app frameworks like Ionic, or desktop frameworks such as Electron.

To begin with, however, we cover how to make a CRUD app 'the old fashioned way', with static HTML.

Once you know how to do this, we will build on this knowledge to make our API, then create a few different front-ends
to demonstrate working with the API.

### PHP 7

This app was written using PHP 7. There *may* be backwards compatability issues, primarily around type hinting.
